# Superliminal Bingo Core

This is a backend of SL Bingo, a tool that aims to show you the collectibles and achievements you got in [Pillow Castle](http://www.pillowcastlegames.com/)'s game Superliminal. It is designed for speedrunners and for bingo racers. It's similar to Celeste's [Bingo UI](https://gamebanana.com/mods/34281) mod.
